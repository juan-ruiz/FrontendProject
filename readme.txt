 This is a vertical-scrolling single-page website to serve as a landing page
 for one of strv's project. it is composed of 1 index banner, an "About us"
 section, a "How it works" section, a comments section, a banner at the bottom
 of the page, and a footer with fb and twitter share buttons.

 To start working on this project, node.js has to be installed on the dev
 machine

 The first step to deploy this site is to download all its dependencies,
 to do so, please open a terminal, cd/to/the/project/folder and execute
 "npm install", the npm package manager will download all the project's
 dependencies.

 After downloading the site's dependencies, the next step is to create the
 site's bundle, this project uses gulp as a way of streamlining this process
 all you have to do is execute "gulp" in the project folder and you're good to
 go.

 Bundled with this site, it is a very small app server implemented using
 express, it runs through port 80 and serves static files through a /public
 folder

 To start everything just do "node server.js" and then open a browser to the
 localhost/  the site should be there :).
